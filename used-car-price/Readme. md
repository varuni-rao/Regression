This folder contains the final submission for my capstone project as a part of Applied Data Sciences Program from MIT Professional Education through Great Learning.

The objective is to predict the price of a used car in Indian used car market space using Machine Learning algorithms.

We had a very highly skewed dataset and needed a log transformation of the target variable. 
Another big issue with the data was that it was highly biased with records from the economy section of the used car space 
and have very few high riced luxury cars. This made building the model a challenge.

I used a few commonly used machine learning algorithms, which included Linear Regression, 
with l2 regularization (ridge) and l1 regularization (lasso) and also (l2/l1) regularization.
I also tried Decision Trees, Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms 
and a Sequential model with 5 hidden layers.

XGboost gave the best value for r2 and mae. Since the data was so highly biased and had many outliers,
I decided to use mae as the evaluation metric to compare the models. ALl the values for rmse, mae displayed are in lakh Indian rupees

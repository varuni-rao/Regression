This folder holds the Jupyter notebook for Boston House Price Prediction.

Boston House Price Prediction is a popular dataset found in the Keras library as well as on Kaggle. 
It is a dataset of median homes in Boston in the 1940s. 
There are 12 features that affect the price of a median home and the objective is to determine the 
median value of a home in Boston suburb. 
The target feature is MEDV and is in the scale of 1000 dollars.

This is a great project for a beginner and helps develop an understanding about different regression techniques.

I did this project as a preparation for a more complex Used Car Price Prediction project which will also be uploaded next.
The fact that the dataset provided did not have any missing values made the project a good problem to focus mostly 
on learning regression machine learning models without having to worry about data imputation.
